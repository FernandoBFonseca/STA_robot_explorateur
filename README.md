# STA_robot_explorateurðŸ¤–

This is a project developed for the subject SystÃ¨mes de transport autonome (Autonomous transport systems) at the Ã‰cole Centrale de Lille, where the goal of the project is to make an explorer robot, equipped with a lidar, able to recognize the environment around it, map it and move around in it.

The project was developed using ROS and the code in ROS Noetic can be found in the following git: https://github.com/FernandoBFonseca/STA_robot_explorateur_ros. However, it is highly recommended that instead of cloning it directly, you run the setup.sh code, which not only clones the repertory to the correct folder catkin_ws/src, but also sends it to your RaspberryPi and compiles it

So, in this repertory you will find a folder with the code developed for the Arduino connected to the motors and encoders, the project subject and also the setup.sh file, that as already explained, will clone the part of the project developed in ROS in the good repository

Have a nice day!
